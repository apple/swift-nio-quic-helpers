# Contributing guide

Welcome to the [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) community! Contributions to the SwiftNIO QUIC Helpers project are welcomed and encouraged.

We welcome developers from all backgrounds and experience levels. A diverse and friendly community has more great ideas, more unique perspectives, and produces better software.

## How you can help

- Reporting bugs with clear, reproducible steps as GitHub Issues
- Improving documentation to make the project more accessible
- Adding or enhancing tests to improve reliability and coverage
- Proposing and implementing enhancements

## Setting up your environment

See the [README](README.md) for prerequisites and build instructions.

## Issues and Bugs

Use GitHub Issues to report bugs, request features, or provide feedback. Please submit an Issue before doing time-consuming or complex work to get acknowledgement from the maintainers.

Specify the following:

- SwiftNIO QUIC Helpers version
- Contextual information (e.g. what you were trying to achieve with `swift-nio-quic-helpers`)
- Simplest possible steps to reproduce
- The more complex the steps are, the lower the priority will be.
- A pull request with failing test case is preferred, but it's just fine to paste the test case into the issue description.
- Anything that might be relevant in your opinion, such as:
    - Swift version or the output of `swift --version`
    - OS version and the output of `uname -a`
    - Network configuration

## Submitting pull requests

A good SwiftNIO QUIC Helpers pull request is:

- Concise, and contains as few changes as needed to achieve the end result.
- Tested, ensuring that any tests provided failed before the patch and pass after it.
- Documented, adding API documentation as needed to cover new functions and properties.
- Accompanied by a great commit message

### Tests and running CI

Thorough testing is required for all contributions and all checks must pass before merging.

Local Testing: Before submission, ensure all changes pass local tests:
```
swift test
``` 
Automated Tests: New features and bug fixes require corresponding automated tests (unit, integration, end-to-end) that validate the intended behavior and prevent regressions. You are responsible for verifying the correctness and coverage of all tests.
